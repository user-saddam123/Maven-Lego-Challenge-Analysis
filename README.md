## Challenge Objective: 
[游대Home](#table-of-content)
The Objective of this Maven LEGO Challenge, we'll need to stack our imagination and analytical prowess to piece together an interactive dashboard or visual that lets users(Client) explore the insight from history and evolution of LEGO sets from the past 5 decades.

## About The Data Set:
[游대Home](#table-of-content)
For this project I have provided a CSV file type dataset. This dataset comprises a single table containing 18,459 records and 14 fields.

Specifically, the dataset focuses on LEGO sets released from 1970 to 2022, encompassing various details such as each set's theme, number of pieces, recommended age, retail price, and an image associated with each set.

### Data Dictionary & Secrets:
[游대Home](#table-of-content)
Before proceeding further with the project, here is a brief overview of the data and its fields:

 *  set_id : The official LEGO item number, ensuring 100% uniqueness.

 * name: The name of the LEGO set.

 * year: The release year of the set.

 * theme: The LEGO theme to which the set belongs, with 152 distinct values.

 * subtheme: The subtheme within the theme. This field contains blank values in 18.17% of rows and has 874 distinct values.

 * themeGroup: The overall group to which the theme belongs, with 17 distinct values.

 * category: The type of set, categorized into 7 distinct values.

 * pieces: The number of pieces in the set. Approximately 21% of rows have blank values, totaling 3,924.

 * minifigs: The number of mini figures included in the set. Approximately 54% of rows have blank values, indicating 10,058 rows with no minifigure data.

 * agerange_min: The minimum recommended age for the set.

 * US_retailPrice: The US retail price at launch. Around 62% of rows are blank, amounting to 11,475 rows with no average price data.

 * bricksetURL: The URL for the set on brickset.com.

 * thumbnailURL: A small image of the set.

 * imageURL: The full-size image of the set.

### Dashboard Overview:
[游대Home](#table-of-content)
I have developed a Power BI dashboard consisting of two pages to meet the objectives of the challenge. The first page is divided into six sections, each providing detailed insights and analysis as follows:

* #### Quick Insight Section: 
This section includes key performance indicators (KPIs), headings, project objectives, and other relevant information.

* #### Trend Overview: 
In this section, I have analyzed various trends over the years, presenting different insights based on temporal analysis.

* #### Category-Based Insights: 
Visualizations and analysis related to categories are presented in this section, offering insights into different sets based on their categories.

* #### Theme-Based Insights: 
This section focuses on theme-based visuals and insights, providing a deeper understanding of the data categorized by themes.

* #### Sub-Theme-Based Insights: 
Here, analysis and visuals are based on sub-themes, offering insights into the subsets within larger themes.

* #### Theme Group-Based Insights: 
Insights and analysis based on theme groups are presented in this section, providing a broader perspective on thematic categorization.

The second page is designed to be user-friendly, featuring standard and new KPIs along with slicers. Users can easily select a specific LEGO set and gain insights about it in an easy-to-understand manner, facilitating interactive exploration of the data.

### Tools Used:
[游대Home](#table-of-content)
In line with the objectives and project requirements, I have utilized Power BI, a powerful business intelligence tool, for dashboard creation. Additionally, I have employed Excel to some extent to ensure that the data is formatted clearly and in a usable manner.

### Important tips for using bookmarks:
[游대Home](#table-of-content)
Sometimes, after clicking on a bookmark, the filters may not apply as expected. In such cases, try clicking on another bookmark within the same group and then return to the desired bookmark. This action often resolves any issues with the bookmark filters not applying correctly.

#

## Detailed Explanation:
[游대Home](#table-of-content)
At the top of my dashboard, I have incorporated 7 key performance indicators (KPIs) to provide a quick overview and basic understanding of the dataset and dashboard. These KPIs are as follows:
